# myTeams
## Purpose:
It's 2nd year project of Epitech.<br/>
The goal of this project is to create a **server** and a **CLI client** in C.<br/>
The network communication will be achieved through the use of TCP sockets.<br/>

Your server is able to manage a collaborative communication application like the well known Microsoft Teams.<br/>
A collaborative communication application is a service able to manage severall communication teams, where discussion are organised like following:<br/>

Here are the features implemented :
• Creating/Joining/Leaving a team<br/>
• Creating a user<br/>
• Creating a channel in a team<br/>
• Creating a thread in a channel<br/>
• Creating a comment in a thread<br/>
• Saving & restoring users, teams, channels, threads & associated comments<br/>
• Personnal discussion (from a user to an other)<br/>
• Saving & restoring personnal discussion<br/>

## Usage:

```

port is the port number on which the server socket listens.
```

 - Usage client:
